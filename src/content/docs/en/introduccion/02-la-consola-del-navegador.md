To be able to follow the course and test what you are doing, you will need a web browser for now. You probably already have one installed, if not, I recommend that you install Google Chrome or Brave Browser.

All browsers have a tool called console. The console allows us to run JavaScript code in real time and see the result. There we can also see the errors, warnings and traces that occur in our code.

Although we can run JavaScript code in other ways, to start, we are going to use this tool that the browser offers us.

:::note
Remember that we call code the instructions that we give to the computer to do something.

## How to open the console
To open the browser console you must do the following:
- Open your favorite web browser, for example, Google Chrome.
- Go to the about:blank page in the address bar. This way we will avoid being bothered by the web page we have loaded.
- Right click anywhere on the page and select the Inspect Element or Inspect option.
Here you can run your JavaScript code and see the result. This is what we will use in the first classes of the course. Later we will move on to using a more powerful code editor.
